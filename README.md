# AniTA - AI-powered Assignment Feedback Tool
AniTA (AI-powered iNteractive Teaching Assistant) is a web application designed to centralize assignment submission and deliver fast, AI-generated feedback based on professor-uploaded rubrics. Built by a team of students for a Big Data Architecture course, AniTA leverages large language models (LLMs) to evaluate student work and provide clear, point-by-point grading explanations. The system supports both student and professor dashboards to streamline the academic experience.
